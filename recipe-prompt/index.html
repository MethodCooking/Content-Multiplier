Serves 6

For the chicken:
• 1.8kg (4lb) chicken
• 3 garlic cloves, finely grated
• 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
• Sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper
• 8 red onions, cut into wedges

For the pangrattato:
• 80ml (2¾ fl oz) extra virgin olive oil
• 100g (3½ oz) stale sourdough bread, made into breadcrumbs
• 2 tablespoons chopped blanched almonds
• 4 garlic cloves, chopped
• 1 teaspoon chilli flakes
• Leaves from a small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped
• Finely grated zest of 1 unwaxed lemon

Method:
1. Set the chicken on your work surface, breast-side down, legs towards you. Using good kitchen scissors or poultry shears, cut through the flesh and bone along each side of the backbone. Remove the backbone and keep it for stock (freeze it until you've gathered other bones to cook along with it).

2. Open out the chicken, turn it over so it is skin-side up, then flatten it by pressing hard on the breastbone with the heel of your hand. Remove any big globules of fat and neaten any ragged bits of skin. Now you have a spatchcocked bird.

3. Gently lift the skin on the breast of the bird so that you can put your hand in between the skin and the flesh (try not to tear the skin). Mix the garlic with 1 tablespoon of the extra virgin olive oil and some seasoning, and carefully push this under the skin. Cover with cling film and put in the fridge for a couple of hours.

4. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6 and take the chicken out of the fridge. Put the onions into a roasting tin and pour on the remaining 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Set the chicken on top, breast-side up, season the outside, and roast for 1 hour.

5. Meanwhile, make the pangrattato. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and sauté the breadcrumbs for about 4 minutes. Add the almonds, garlic, and chilli and cook for another minute or so. Remove from the heat and mix with the parsley and lemon zest, chopping everything together.

6. Cut the chicken into serving pieces and put it onto a warmed platter, on top of the red onions. Pour any cooking juices over the top, scatter on the pangrattato, and serve.</p>
